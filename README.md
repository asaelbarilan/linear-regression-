# linear-regression-
# i created basic OLS class and two desendent classes for Gradient descent and coordinate descent 
# the implmentation include analytic solution for OLS(oridinary least squares) 
# gradient descent,coordinate descent and regularization  with  ridge regression, i used sklearn boston data for this implementation
# also -there is MSE comparison between test and train- im showing the data is different with a t-test
